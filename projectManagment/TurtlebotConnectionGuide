1. SD card connection - Insert SD card to computer

2. Go to home (in terminal)

3. write cd media
3.1 then: cd <username>
3.2 then: cd writeable
3.3 write: cd etc
3.4 then: cd netplan
3.5 then: sudo gedit 50-cloud-init.yaml

4. Now you have opened the yaml, file and need to specify a local hotspot and the password (Make sure that the name of the hotspot is simple)

5. Unmount SD card from computer
5.1 sudo umount /media/brugernavn/writable

6. Plug SD card into turtlebot

7. Turn on turtlebot (if beeping charge battery)

8. Connect computer to same hotspot as turtlebot 

9. Finding turtlebot on local network
9.1 in terminal write: sudo arp-scan -l
9.2 Now you should have the turtlebot IP adress (172.20.10.6)(maybe it changes i dont know (it does))
9.3 then: ssh pi@<IP-adress> (without <>)
9.4 enter 'turtlebot' (this is the password)

10. Now you are connected to the turtlebots local terminal

(Option)
11. Testing robot
11.1 In turtlebots local terminal write: screen (this will open new terminal)
11.2 Press enter
11.3 write: ros2 launch mqtt_2_cmd_pkg mqtt_interface.launch.py
11.4 When this has loaded and the last command line says something like: run!, enter: ctrl + a + c‚Äù
11.5 Previous step should redirect you again, now enter: python3 mqtt_pub.py to run preloaded test code
11.6 Enter linear velocity (no more than 0.22), and angular velocity (no limit)

12. Uploading code, and building project
12.1 From the turtlebots local terminal type: scree, and press enter
12.2 use ctrl + a + c, to create two additional screens (We need an A,B and a C screen)
12.3 Navigate to screen C (ctrl + a + p and ctrl + a + n (for previous screen and next screen))
12.4 type: source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
12.5 type: export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
12.6 type: ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py
12.7 Navigate to screen A
12.8 Type at once: Command 1: source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash, Command 2: ros2 topic echo /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/TwistStamped
12.9 Nothing will happen but this is good let it run
12.10 Navigate to screen B (Here we turn on motors)
12.11 Type: source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
12.12 Type: ros2 service call /motor_power std_srvs/srv/SetBool "{data: true}"
12.13 Type: cd ~/code_ws/src/Semesterproject_3_Mobile_Robot_Systems
12.14 Type: PYTHONPATH="$PWD:$PYTHONPATH" python3 Main/main.py
12.15 Program should run!
